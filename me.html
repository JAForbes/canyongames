			<p><span>My name is James Forbes</span></p>
			<p>I am a songwriter and game designer.</p>
			<p>Over the years I have made many things, but they have been sprawled over a multitude of services and websites. &nbsp;</p>
			<p><span>The purpose of this page is to quash this diaspora and reunite the tribes to a new home.</span></p>
			<p>If you want to reach me...</p>
			<p>You can find me on twitter at&nbsp;<a  href="./twitter.html" target="page-content" <span>@CanyonOasis</span></p></a>
			<p>I don't believe in Facebook. &nbsp;It is not a book of faces it is a house of lies. &nbsp;It should be called LiesHouse</p>

			<p>On this page you will find music and games I have made or are making.  If you click the home icon you'll be taken to my blog.</p>
